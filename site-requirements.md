# Interior Design Visualization Platform Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a NextJS website that enables interior designers to create visualizations of spaces by uploading reference images and generating AI-powered interior design renders.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: NextJS
- **Database**: Prisma
- **Payment Processing**: Lemon Squeezy
- **Email Service**: Resend
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI image generation API

## Core Functionality

### Image Upload System
1. Allow users to upload the following:
   - Up to 3 element/furniture images
   - 1 base scene image (room layout)
2. Image upload should include:
   - Preview functionality
   - Validation for file types and sizes
   - Error handling for failed uploads

### AI Rendering Process
1. Send uploaded images to OpenAI's image generation API
2. Process the inputs along with a layout specification
3. Generate a visualization of the interior design concept
4. Return the rendered image to the user interface

### Customization Options
1. **Lighting Selection**:
   - Implement a dropdown menu with lighting options
   - Options should affect the final render result
   - Lighting choices may include: Natural daylight, Evening, Warm, Cool, etc.

### Review & Approval Workflow
1. Allow designers to review their previous renders
2. Implement an approval system for completed renders
3. Maintain a history of projects for each user
4. Enable comparisons between different versions

### Payment Integration
1. Connect with Lemon Squeezy for payment processing
2. Implement a credit-based system:
   - $1 per credit (1 render = 1 credit)
   - Bundle pricing options:
     - 1 credit: $1
     - 4 credits: $TBD (discount)
     - 5 credits: $TBD (discount)
     - 10 credits: $TBD (discount)
3. Display current credit balance
4. Implement payment history and receipts

## User Experience Requirements

### User Authentication
1. User registration and login system
2. Profile management
3. Secure authentication using industry standards

### Dashboard
1. Overview of current credit balance
2. Quick access to:
   - New render creation
   - Previous renders
   - Account settings
   - Payment options

### Render Creation Flow
1. Step-by-step interface for uploading images
2. Lighting selection interface
3. Preview capabilities before final submission
4. Credit usage confirmation
5. Loading state during AI processing
6. Result display with options to save, share, or iterate

### Render Management
1. Gallery view of previous renders
2. Filter and search capabilities
3. Option to duplicate and modify existing renders
4. Export/download functionality for completed renders

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
1. User profiles
2. Projects/Renders
3. Payment/Credit tracking
4. Image storage references

### API Endpoints
1. User authentication
2. Image upload and management
3. Render processing and retrieval
4. Payment and credit management

### Deployment & Infrastructure
1. Hosting platform (e.g., Vercel for NextJS)
2. Image storage solution (e.g., AWS S3)
3. Database hosting (e.g., Planetscale for Prisma)
4. API rate limiting and security measures
5. Backup and recovery plan

### Compliance & Security
1. GDPR compliance for user data
2. Secure payment processing
3. Image rights management
4. Data encryption in transit and at rest

## Future Considerations
1. Enhanced AI customization options
2. Batch processing for multiple rooms
3. Project collaboration features
4. Mobile application
5. Professional tier with additional features

## Implementation Timeline
[To be determined based on resource availability and project scope]

## Success Metrics
1. User registration and retention rates
2. Average credits consumed per user
3. Render completion and approval rates
4. Payment conversion metrics
5. User satisfaction metrics
